# Testing

Written as part of Phase 6 (deployment & hardening) of the Astro/CMS
rebuild program. There is no unit test suite — this project's test
coverage is entirely Playwright end-to-end, deliberately: almost all of
the actual logic worth verifying is the interaction between Astro
SSR/middleware, D1, and the admin UI, which unit tests in isolation
wouldn't catch (several real bugs this session were only found because a
full e2e flow was exercised — see `docs/content-model.md`'s history and
git log for specifics).

## Suite layout

`tests/e2e/*.spec.js`, run via `npx playwright test`. Two Playwright
projects, each against a different running server (`playwright.config.js`):

| Project | Spec files | Server | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `static` | `public-pages.spec.js`, `contact-form.spec.js` | `astro build && astro preview` | These pages don't need the real auth/D1 CRUD path — `astro preview` is faster to boot and closer to a CDN-cached static response |
| `worker` | `admin.spec.js` | `wrangler dev --local` | Exercises the real ported auth (`adminAuth.js`), D1 CRUD, and `waitUntil` background delivery — `astro preview` doesn't run a real `workerd` runtime, so this is the only way to test those for real |

Run everything: `npx playwright test --workers=1`. `--workers=1` isn't
required for correctness (tests are written to be independent) but keeps
output readable and avoids two Playwright workers racing to
build/rebuild `dist/` at once (see the Windows gotcha below).

## Patterns used here (and why)

- **`toPass()` instead of `networkidle`** for anything with an on-page
  widget that polls in the background (Turnstile) — `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
  never resolves against continuous background requests, a
  documented Playwright anti-pattern. Wrap the assertion in
  `expect(async () => {...}).toPass({ timeout })` instead and let it retry.
- **Fill-inside-the-retry-block, not before it** for any form that clears
  itself on success — otherwise a `toPass()` retry after an
  already-succeeded-but-unobserved submission re-clicks an empty form and
  fails on client-side validation, which reads as a flaky test but is
  actually a real ordering bug in the test itself.
- **`page.request`, not `page.goto`, for verifying redirects that get
  deleted afterward** — a 301 response is aggressively cached by the
  browser; `page.goto`-ing the same URL again after deleting the redirect
  can serve the cached 301 instead of hitting the server, making a correct
  delete look broken. `page.request` doesn't share the browser's HTTP
  cache.
- **Repeat flaky-looking failures before dismissing them** — every
  Playwright-surfaced bug in this project's history (duplicate form-field
  ids, a `.nullable()` Zod mismatch, the two patterns above, a dedup false
  positive in a test's own fixture data) was found by treating
  `--repeat-each=3`-style flakiness as a signal of a real bug, not noise.
  Confirm a fix is real the same way: repeat it 2-3 times before trusting
  a single green run.
- **Clean up test-generated D1 rows before committing**, but only for
  data that would otherwise misrepresent real content (leads, redirects,
  smoke-test projects) — version/audit-log rows are meant to accumulate
  and are left alone.

## Known environment quirk (Windows only)

`astro build` intermittently fails with `EPERM`/`Assertion failed` errors
from a stale Windows file handle on `dist/client`, usually left behind by
a `wrangler dev` or `astro preview` process that wasn't fully torn down.
Fix: kill lingering Node/workerd/esbuild processes holding the handle,
then rebuild —
```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "node|esbuild|wrangler|workerd" } | Stop-Process -Force
```
This isn't a code bug; it doesn't happen in Cloudflare's own CI (Linux),
only in local Windows dev.

## What's deliberately not covered

- Turnstile's actual challenge/scoring logic — the widget uses
  Cloudflare's published testing sitekey (always passes) in every test
  environment; there's no way to exercise real bot-scoring from an
  automated test, and no reason to (that's Cloudflare's surface, not
  this app's).
- Cross-browser matrix — `devices['Desktop Chrome']` only. This is a
  portfolio/lead-gen site with a small, known audience; the cost of a
  full browser matrix isn't justified yet.
- Load/performance testing — see `docs/performance/PERFORMANCE_FINDINGS.md`
  for the one-time Lighthouse-driven investigation that preceded this
  rebuild; nothing ongoing.
