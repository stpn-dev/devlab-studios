/**
 * The schema and the code have to agree about their shared vocabularies.
 *
 * TWICE now a CHECK constraint has silently discarded a value the code was
 * confident about, because the write went through `INSERT OR IGNORE`:
 *
 *   lead_sources.type       rejected 'osm_nominatim' -> one of four seeded
 *                           sources simply never existed
 *   lead_usage_daily.metric rejected 'nominatim_requests' -> the counter row
 *                           was never created, so the conditional UPDATE that
 *                           reserves budget matched nothing and every discovery
 *                           run reported `daily_request_budget_exhausted` on a
 *                           database with zero recorded usage
 *
 * Neither raised an error. Both produced valid SQL, an exit code of zero, and a
 * feature that quietly did nothing. `OR IGNORE` is correct for both call sites
 * - a re-run seed and a get-or-create counter - which is precisely why the
 * constraint has to be checked somewhere else, and why asserting on the
 * migration TEXT would not do it. These tests exercise the real code against
 * the real schema and look at what survived.
