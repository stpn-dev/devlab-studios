/**
 * Attributing an inbound message to a lead, and a bounce to a draft.
 *
 * THIS IS WHERE THE MAILBOX MEETS THE CRM, and the direction of dependency is
 * deliberate: the mailbox reads the lead engine's tables to find out who a
 * message is about, and hands the answer to the lead engine's own
 * `recordBounce`. It does not decide anything about suppression, stages or
 * campaigns — the CRM owns that data and has owned it since before this
 * mailbox existed. Inventing a second bounce state here would mean two systems
 * disagreeing about whether an address is dead.
 *
 * THREE ROUTES TO A DRAFT, TRIED IN ORDER OF CERTAINTY:
 *
 *   1. VERP — the draft id in the envelope recipient. Exact, and free, but only
 *      if the transmitting agent honoured the envelope sender we asked for.
 *      n8n's built-in Send Email node does NOT (it derives MAIL FROM from the
 *      `From:` header and exposes no override), so this route cannot be the
 *      only one.
 *   2. MESSAGE-ID — our own id, echoed inside the DSN's returned headers. RFC
 *      3464 requires a DSN to carry the original headers, and we control the
 *      Message-ID absolutely because we build the message. This is the route
 *      that has to work, and it is why the id is encoded there at all.
 *   3. ADDRESS — the failed recipient, resolved to the most recent draft sent
 *      to it. A heuristic, used last, and it still produces a draftId so the
 *      single existing `recordBounce(draftId)` path stays the only one.
