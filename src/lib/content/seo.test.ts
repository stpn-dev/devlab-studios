/**
 * The alignment guard.
 *
 * `loadPageSeo` falls back to the static file whenever the CMS has no row for a
 * slug. That is the right runtime behaviour — a missing record should never
 * blank a page's metadata — but it also means a slug can drift out of sync and
 * nothing anywhere fails. Two pages had drifted: the Solutions record was keyed
 * 'solutions' while the page asked for 'services', and the Insights record was
 * misspelled 'insigths'. Both screens accepted edits and discarded them.
 *
 * The static file is the fallback of last resort, so if a published route is
 * missing from it, that route has no guaranteed metadata at all.
