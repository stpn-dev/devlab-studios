/**
 * Hands approved drafts to the configured external sender.
 *
 * This route is deliberately NOT under `/api/admin/`, because an automation
 * cannot hold a browser session — so it carries its own bearer-token gate,
 * which fails closed when unconfigured. See `lead-engine/outbox/auth.js`.
 *
 * Nothing here sends. It returns message bodies; something outside this
 * application transmits them and calls the `/sent` route back. Every
 * compliance gate — suppression re-checked at this moment, AI content
 * safeguards — runs before a message is handed over, on this side of the
 * boundary where it is testable.
 *
 * A collected draft is never offered twice. If the sender dies before
 * transmitting, that message goes unsent rather than being mailed twice.
