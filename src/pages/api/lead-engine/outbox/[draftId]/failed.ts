 * the CMS unreachable, a runtime error.
 *
 * The workflow previously reported every send-node error to `/bounced` with
 * `kind: 'hard'`, which permanently suppresses the address and moves the lead
 * to NO_CONTACT. That meant a missing npm module on the n8n container would
 * have quietly destroyed prospects — and the more broken the infrastructure,
 * the more of them. Nothing on this route suppresses anything.
