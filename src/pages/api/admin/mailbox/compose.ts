/**
 * Starts a new conversation from the Compose button.
 *
 * NOTHING IS SENT HERE, exactly as with a reply — this writes a
 * `mailbox_outbound` row and the configured external sender collects it. Cc,
 * Bcc and outbound attachments are deliberately absent rather than accepted and
 * ignored: `mailbox_outbound` has no columns for them, so a field the UI
 * offered would be silently dropped on the way to the wire, which is worse than
 * not offering it.
 *
 * Suppression is re-checked inside `composeNew`. A new message gets the same
 * gates as a reply — arguably it needs them more, since nobody wrote to us
 * first.
