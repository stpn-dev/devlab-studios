/**
 * Accepts a file for an outgoing message, before that message exists.
 *
 * The upload is stored UNCLAIMED: bytes go to R2, metadata to D1 with a null
 * `outbound_id`. Pressing Send claims it. That split exists because the
 * operator picks files while composing, and there is nothing to attach them to
 * yet — see repositories/outboundAttachments.js.
 *
 * FILENAME AND CONTENT TYPE ARE NOT TAKEN ON TRUST. Both come from the
 * browser, which takes them from a file the operator chose but which a crafted
 * request can set to anything. The filename is sanitized with the same function
 * the ingest path uses, and the content type is reduced to `type/subtype` —
 * both end up in a `Content-Disposition` header on a message we send to a third
 * party, and a CR in either appends headers of the sender's choosing.
 *
 * The per-file cap is checked here; the per-MESSAGE total is checked at claim
 * time, because a message is not a message until it exists.
