/**
 * One endpoint per mail-client folder.
 *
 * WHY FOLDERS ARE A ROUTE PARAMETER RATHER THAN FOUR ENDPOINTS: they are four
 * different QUESTIONS about the same mailbox, and three of them are not "which
 * threads" at all —
 *
 *   inbox    — threads with inbound mail, state 'inbox'
 *   sent     — threads containing a message we actually transmitted
 *   outbox   — `mailbox_outbound` rows queued or collected but NOT confirmed
 *   drafts   — `mailbox_outbound` rows saved and never handed over
 *   archived — threads the operator filed away
 *
 * Outbox and Drafts read a different table from Inbox and Sent, so they return
 * `messages` rather than `threads`. Collapsing them into one shape would mean
 * inventing a thread for a reply that has none yet.
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OUTBOX AND SENT IS THE POINT OF HAVING BOTH. A reply
 * moves to Sent only when the transmitter confirms it; until then it sits in
 * Outbox. A mail client that showed a queued reply as "sent" would be lying
 * about the one fact the operator needs — whether the person received it.
