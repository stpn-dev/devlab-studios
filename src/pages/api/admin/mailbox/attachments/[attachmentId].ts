/**
 * Downloads one attachment.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING, because every byte and every string
 * involved came from a stranger:
 *
 *   1. The R2 key comes from the DATABASE ROW, never from the request. The
 *      caller supplies an attachment id, which is looked up; a key built from
 *      user input is how a download route becomes an arbitrary-object reader.
 *   2. The content type is re-derived through the allowlist, not read from the
 *      stored object. `text/html` served as itself, from an origin the operator
 *      is signed into, would execute script in the admin session.
 *   3. `Content-Disposition: attachment` with a sanitized filename, so nothing
 *      renders inline and the filename cannot break out of the header.
 *   4. `nosniff`, so a browser does not decide for itself that our
 *      `application/octet-stream` is really HTML.
