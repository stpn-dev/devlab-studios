/**
 * The inbox list.
 *
 * Authentication is the `/api/admin/` gate in src/middleware.ts, which runs
 * before this module does — the same arrangement every Lead CRM route uses, and
 * for the same reason: re-checking per route is duplicated security logic that
 * can drift from the real gate.
 *
 * With no `mailbox` filter this lists the HUMAN mailboxes only. Bounces and
 * DMARC reports are deliberately excluded from the default view: a DMARC
 * aggregate arrives daily from every receiver that has an opinion, and burying
 * a prospect's reply under a week of Google telemetry is how a reply goes
 * unanswered.
