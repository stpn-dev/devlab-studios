 * Downloads the original message.

 * THIS IS THE ESCAPE HATCH THAT MAKES "NEVER SILENTLY DISCARD" MEAN SOMETHING.
 * A message the parser could not read still produced a row and still has its
 * bytes here, so a person can open it in a real mail client and see what
 * arrived. Without this route, `parse_status = 'failed'` would be a label on
 * something nobody can inspect.
 *
 * Served as `message/rfc822` with an attachment disposition, so the browser
 * downloads it rather than trying to render it. The R2 object's own stored
 * type is not used; it is hard-coded here, because the type of THIS object is
 * something we know rather than something the message gets to tell us.
