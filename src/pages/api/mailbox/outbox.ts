/**
 * Hands queued replies to the configured external sender.
 *
 * Outside `/api/admin/` because an automation cannot hold a browser session, so
 * it carries its own bearer-token gate which FAILS CLOSED when unconfigured —
 * the same arrangement as the lead engine's outbox, using the same constant-
 * time comparison rather than a second copy of it.
 *
 * WHAT IT RETURNS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY. Each item carries a complete
 * RFC 5322 message in `raw` and the SMTP envelope separately in `envelope`. The
 * transmitter's whole job is `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, `DATA`.
 *
 * That split is not decoration. The envelope sender is a per-message VERP
 * address and is NOT derivable from the message — that is the entire point of
 * VERP — and the message carries `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To` and `References`
 * that decide whether the reply threads in the recipient's client. n8n's
 * built-in Send Email node can set none of those: its own documentation states
 * it "does not support setting headers like In-Reply-To and References", and it
 * derives MAIL FROM from the From: header with no override. Handing it fields
 * to assemble would have produced replies that do not thread and bounces that
 * correlate to nothing.
 *
 * A collected reply is never offered twice. If the transmitter dies between
 * collecting and sending, that reply goes unsent and sits in the CMS for a
 * person — rather than being mailed twice, which is unrecoverable.
