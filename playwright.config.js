  // means downloading the bundle, hydrating, THEN fetching its data before
  // anything renders. On a cold worker that routinely passes 5s, so the first
  // assertion after a `page.goto` failed roughly one run in three while the
  // page itself was perfectly healthy. That is the whole of this suite's
  // long-standing "known flaky" set -- the check-in list and players list
  // tests -- not three unrelated bugs.
  //
  // 15s is still an order of magnitude under the test budget, so a page that
  // genuinely never renders still fails fast rather than hanging.
